# woop

Hello everyone, 
  I am the developer of WoopChat.
  WoopChat is a minimalist chat tool. I hope that through this platform you can meet more interesting people and enjoy a more interesting life.
  In the future, I will iterate many interesting new features, which cannot be disclosed here for the time being due to confidentiality.
  The public beta version 1.0 is expected to be released in June. Although there are many imperfect functions in the public beta version, I will make up for it as soon as possible.
  I am very much looking forward to your valuable comments and suggestions, which are very important to me. Thank you for your use and suggestions!

Best wishesÔºÅ
